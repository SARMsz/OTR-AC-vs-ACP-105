<h1>OTR-AC vs ACP-105: My Personal SARMs Showdown</h1>

<p>When it comes to clean, low-side-effect SARMs, <strong>OTR-AC</strong> and <strong>ACP-105</strong> are two of the best I‚Äôve ever run. Both are newer, more refined, and designed to give you lean gains without frying your hormones or liver. But they‚Äôre not the same. I ran both solo for 8 weeks and tracked everything. Here‚Äôs what I found.</p>

<h2>How I Tested OTR-AC and ACP-105</h2>
<p>I ran each SARM separately for 8-week cycles with 4 weeks off between them. Training, diet, and sleep stayed consistent. I tracked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bodyweight & lean mass (weekly)</li>
  <li>Strength (main compound lifts)</li>
  <li>Recovery speed</li>
  <li>Side effects: suppression, libido, sleep, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>No stacks. No TRT. Just me and the compound.</p>

<h2>What Is OTR-AC?</h2>
<p><strong>OTR-AC</strong> stands for <strong>Ostarine-O-Acetate</strong>. It‚Äôs a modified, faster-acting version of MK-2866 (Ostarine). The acetate ester makes it more bioavailable and fast-hitting. I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/otr-ac-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this OTR-AC from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My OTR-AC Results</h3>
<p>I felt this one almost instantly. Within a week, I noticed tighter muscle tone, quicker recovery, and slight strength jumps. By week 4, I‚Äôd gained 4‚Äì5 lbs of lean muscle and lost visible fat without tweaking my diet. The fast-acting nature kept workouts intense and recovery short.</p>

<h3>OTR-AC Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fast absorption and quick results</li>
  <li>Good lean gains without water bloat</li>
  <li>Great for cutting or clean recomp</li>
  <li>Very mild suppression for me</li>
</ul>

<h3>OTR-AC Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not as powerful as RADs or YK11 for size</li>
  <li>Shorter half-life ‚Äì you may want to dose twice daily</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, lean recomposition, recovery</h4>

<h2>What Is ACP-105?</h2>
<p><strong>ACP-105</strong> is a non-steroidal SARM that‚Äôs often called ‚Äúa smarter S4.‚Äù It builds muscle, boosts recovery, and improves endurance with fewer side effects. I ran <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/acp-105-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this ACP-105 from Chemyo</a> and logged the entire cycle.</p>

<h3>My ACP-105 Results</h3>
<p>This one felt clean and effective. I didn‚Äôt gain a ton of mass, but the quality of muscle was sharp. Strength crept up steadily, especially on lifts like pull-ups and overhead press. I dropped body fat and held onto muscle with ease‚Äîeven in a calorie deficit.</p>

<h3>ACP-105 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Very low suppression (didn‚Äôt need PCT)</li>
  <li>Helps burn fat while preserving lean tissue</li>
  <li>Great endurance and fast recovery</li>
  <li>No vision sides like S4</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACP-105 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not ideal for bulking</li>
  <li>Gains come slower than RADs</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, recomp, beginners</h4>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>Is OTR-AC stronger than ACP-105?</h3>
<p>Not stronger, just faster-acting. Both deliver lean gains, but OTR-AC hits quicker.</p>

<h3>Can I stack OTR-AC with ACP-105?</h3>
<p>You could. They‚Äôre both mild and won‚Äôt overload your system. Ideal for a clean recomp.</p>

<h3>Do I need a PCT for OTR-AC?</h3>
<p>Light suppression. I played it safe with a mini PCT (low-dose Clomid for 2 weeks).</p>

<h3>Do I need a PCT for ACP-105?</h3>
<p>No. It‚Äôs very mild. I didn‚Äôt need one at all.</p>

<h3>Are either liver toxic?</h3>
<p>Nope. Both are non-methylated and clean on the liver.</p>

<h3>How fast do they work?</h3>
<p>OTR-AC: within 7 days. ACP-105: week 2 or 3. You‚Äôll feel both early if your training and diet are on point.</p>

<h3>Which is safer?</h3>
<p>They‚Äôre about equal. No sides for me on either. ACP-105 might edge it out slightly due to even lower suppression.</p>
